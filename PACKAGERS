Packagers
=========

Linux

Windows
-------

You have to package for Windows from Windows, so if you don't have Windows then
you cannot, I guess, package this application for it. If you try to package it on WINE and have success, let us know!!

Requirements
++++++++++++

To package on Windows, you must install these packages from the thirdparty directory:

* python 2.x
* nsis
* wxpython

as well as:

* `cx_freeze <https://sourceforge.net/projects/cx-freeze/>`_ but that currently fails to build occasionally, so use either
 
   * cx_Freeze-4.3.4-cp27-none-win32.whl
   * cx_Freeze-4.3.4-cp27-none-win_amd64.whl

from `lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_


Setup
+++++

Put ``vlc.py`` into ``/usr/shared/pyshared/stopgolibs`` or else cx_freeze will not be able to find it.


Build
+++++

1. Build the project from a DOS (*not* Cygwin or BASH) shell:

   .. code::
      python setup.win.py build

2. This produces ``build\exe.win32-2.7``

3. Launch NSIS and choose ``Compile NSI Scripts``

4. Drag-and-drop the stopgo.nsi script into the NSIS window.

5. You now have ``stopgo-installer.exe``. It should be megabytes in size. If it is less than a few megabytes, you have done something wrong (probably you moved the ``.nsi`` script; it wants to co-exist with the ``exe.win32-2.7`` directory.
