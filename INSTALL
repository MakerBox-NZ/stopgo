StopGo is a Python application, and uses wxPython for its GUI, so it's
very cross-platform. Should work with practically anything. But it's a
multimedia application, so there are some software requirements:


Requirements (Software)
-----------------------

* python `<python.org>`_
* wxpython `<wxpython.org>`_
* vcl `<https://videolan.org>`_
* vlc.py `<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-vlc>`_
* ffmpeg `<https://www.ffmpeg.org/>`_


Requirements (Hardware)
-----------------------

* Computer. Any recent computer should be able to run StopGo. In fact,
  even old computers (my laptop is 12) should run it, although very
  old computers may struggle with playing your movie back *inside of
  StopGo*; after you export it to a movie file, it can be played by
  anything that has a web browser.  
* Webcam. USB webcams are what we have tested, but at least on Linux
  nearly any camera should work, as long as your computer registers it
  as a video device.



Install
-------

StopGo is written in Python, so installation is fairly flexible as
long as you know Python. 

If not, let's keep it simple:


Linux (Users)
+++++++++++++

This is by far the easiest install method.

If you are running Linux (even if only as a live OS), then there
*is* no install. Just download StopGo, double click, and you're
animating.

In order for StopGo to run, though, you will need VLC and ffmpeg
installed. You should be able to install these from your Linux
distribution's software repository.

.. note:: On some versions of Debian (and things based on it, like
   Ubuntu and Mint), the ``ffmpeg`` package actually installs
   ``avconv``. This will NOT work. You NEED
   ffmpeg. https://assetbank.co.uk/support/documentation/install/ffmpeg-debian-squeeze/ffmpeg-debian-jessie/



Mac OS
++++++++

Install VLC.

Install FFmpeg.

StopGo is not yet supported. Coming soon-ish.


Windows
++++++++

Install VLC.

Install FFmpeg.

Run the stopgo-dependencies.exe to install Python and wxPython.

Run the stopgo-installer.exe to install StopGo.

Launch StopGo; if you are prompted, run it in Python.
