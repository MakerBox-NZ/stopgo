Please see the TODO file and the [Github
Issues](https://github.com/notklaatu/stopgo/issues) page for known
bugs. Most of them have been classified in terms of how easy or hard
the bug fix should be, so feel free to try a fix or two.


## Scope and Feature Creep

We are seeking to keep the scope of StopGo fairly limited. It is not
StopGo's place to manage different takes of a scene, or audio files,
or do titles, or apply effects. It is meant to ingest pictures, one
image at a time, which result in one scene of a stop motion motion
picture. This should be rendered out, and then worked with in a proper
video editor, like (Kdenlive)[http://kdenlive.org]
