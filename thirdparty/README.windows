Third Party Libs
================

This directory does not, but should, contain "third party" libraries
required to run StopGo on Windows. 

Wget the contents of each *url file, and you'll end up with all the sources you need.


NSIS
----

This is the "install wizard" builder. It runs on Linux and produces
.exe installers for Windows. This is not a part of StopGo, but the
infrastructure to help install StopGo on Windows.


stopgo-win-deps.nsi
-------------------

NSIS script to build a downloadable (50 mb) installer for Python,
Distutils (not actually needed right now), and wxPython.

Renders ``stopgo_dependencies.exe``

Users really should install these dependencies themselves, but since
so many of our users are anticipated to be children, we are being
nice.


stopgo.nsi
----------

NSIS script to install the entire stopgo directory structure into
C:\Program\ Files

Renders ``stopgo-installer.exe``


VLC
---

Not included; user must install this themselves.


ffmpeg
------

Not included, and that's a problem. We need to include this.
