Third Party Libs
================

This directory does not, but should, contain "third party" libraries
required to run StopGo. Wget the contents of each *url file, and
you'll end up with all the sources you need.

The *SlackBuilds are provided for reference. You can run them, but you
MUST comment out the last command (the makepkg part) or else it'll get
bundled up.



VLC
----

This requires no compilation; just unzip to a valid PYTHONPATH in
working appdir. In practise, the Makefile does this for you.



libPNG
------

As Pat points out in his SlackBuild, libpng is a little confused. Our AppDir ISO will not recognise symlink cheats, so we need to end up with a lib called libpng.so.14
 
cd $PKG/usr/lib${LIBDIRSUFFIX}
  if [ ! -e libpng.so.14 -a -e libpng14.so.14 ]; then
    ln -sf libpng14.so.14 libpng.so.14
  fi



Everything Else
---------------

Compile the libraries and then install with DESTDIR set to the
root of the working .appdir directory.

Do this for both x86 and x86_64 Linux versions.
