# StopGo

StopGo is a stop-motion animation application. It's goal is to be a
simple and direct way to take a series of photographs, with
onion-skinning, to create stop-motion animation. 

StopGo is free and open source.

You are free to use it at home, in the classroom, or anywhere!


## System Requirements

Currently, StopGo works on Linux and Windows.

You should install [VLC](http://videolan.org) and [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org) (**not** libav) before using StopGo.

We are working on Mac support, too!
