TO DO
======

* TODO add ability to import ("convert") a directory of existing images to a timeline
** if a sequence of DSC000X.JPG or whatever is provided, then  adapt project to use 00X.png as prefix for our snapshots

** skill-level: intermediate + sqlite3 experience
* TODO right now we are locked into PNG. We need to determine what format something uses, because some cameras will use JPG or whatever
** skill-level: basic to intermediate
* TODO drag and drop reordering of frames (we have the framework for this, just have not implemented)
** skill-level: intermediate to advanced
* TODO undo history instead of just the most-recent one deletion
** skill-level: intermediate to advanced
* TODO add a probe-camera option so we don't always have to launch stopgo BEFORE attaching camera
** skill-level: basic to intermediate
